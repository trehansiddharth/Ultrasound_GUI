Before using the examples for USB devices, kernel 
drivers must be installed. This is normally performed 
by the PicoScope or PicoLog installer.

In order to install kernel drivers manually run dpinst.exe
which can be found in one of the subfolders.

For x86 you will also need to copy picopp.inf to SYSTEMROOT\inf
and picopp.sys to SYSTEMROOT\system32\drivers.
